Bonne idée : 

Try to have the player have a nicer shape than a rectangle/square. For example, give it a nicer : i.e balls are COVID viruses 
and the player is a bacteria.
 




Mauvaise idée :

Try to make ball movements different depending on their color (random direction that changes along the course of a ball, 
zigzag movements, etc.) I SHOWED HOW TO DO THIS IN THE SECOND TUTORING VIDEO SESSION
 
More difficult: try to make your player fire bullets to destroy enemy balls :-)
